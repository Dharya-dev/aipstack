/**
 * Stub IP protocol handler documenting the required interface.
 * 
 * This dummy class exists to document the interface for protocol handlers
 * expected by @ref IpStack, especially functions called by the stack.
 * 
 * The @ref IpStack is configured with a list of protocol handlers at
 * compile time and not at runtime. This is for performance reasons and
 * to simplify access to protocol handlers from the application.
 * 
 * Each protocol handler is defined through its corresponding service class.
 * (see @ref IpProtocolHandlerStubService) and the list of supported
 * protocol handlers is passed to @ref IpStackService when the @ref IpStack
 * is being instantiated. The @ref IpStack then instantiates the protocol
 * handler service classes to obtain the class types of the actual protocol
 * handles (such as an instantiated @ref IpProtocolHandlerStub in this case).
 * 
 * This protocol handler class provides different functions called by
 * the stack (using simple function calls, not virtual). It is the
 * responsibility of the implementor to make sure that the functions
 * are defined and compatible with how they are called. Note that the stack
 * static_cast's the function arguments to the types specified in this
 * documentation.
 * 
 * This class is also what is exposed via @ref IpStack::getProtocol,
 * so generally it will provide the application-level API for using the
 * implemented IP protocol in addition to the functions called by the stack.
 * 
 * This class only defines the functions called by the stack on the
 * protocol handler. Functions which the protocol handler can call on
 * the stack are defined in @ref IpStack class; perhaps the most important
 * one is @ref IpStack::sendIp4Dgram which is used for sending datagrams.
 * 
 * The stack offers the facilities needed to support Path MTU Discovery.
 * This can be achieved using the @ref IpMtuRef class and the functions @ref
 * IpStack::handleIcmpPacketTooBig and @ref IpStack::handleLocalPacketTooBig.
 * 
 * The protocol handler will have access to the interface (@ref IpIface)
 * from which a datagram has been received, in @ref recvIp4Dgram and also
 * @ref handleIp4DestUnreach. The protocol handler must not remember the
 * interface since it could generally disappear at any time. Currently there
 * is no mechanism to safely keep a reference to an interface.
 * 
 * The @ref IpStack only constructs and destructs protocol handlers, never
 * copies, moves, copy-assigns or move-assigns. Therefore the protocol handler
 * class can have such functions deleted, possibly by inheriting
 * @ref NonCopyable.
 * 
 * @tparam Arg An instantiated Compose template in the service class for the
 *         protocol handler (e.g. @ref IpProtocolHandlerStubService::Compose)
 *         or a type derived from such. Therefore all type aliases defined
 *         there are available in Arg.
