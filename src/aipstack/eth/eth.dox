/**
 * @defgroup eth Ethernet Layer
 * @brief Ethernet network interface support including ARP.
 * 
 * The @ref EthIpIface class provides support for Ethernet-based network interfaces, and
 * should be used by applications integrate such network interfaces into the @ref IpStack.
 * Its primary responsibilities are adding/removing Ethernet headers and operation of ARP.
 * 
 * The @ref eth-hw module defines an abstract hardware-type-specific interface for
 * Ethernet-based network interfaces that may be used by higher layers of the stack
 * to perform specific Ethernet-layer operations. This interface is also implemented
 * by the @ref EthIpIface class.
