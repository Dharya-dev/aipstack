     * value representable in TimeType.
     * 
     * The interpretation of absolute times is relative. Let "Now" be the current time
     * and "ClockPeriodTicks" be the maximum value representable in TimeType plus 1.

     * to be in the past (addition and subtraction are modulo ClockPeriodTicks). This
     * is important for the implementation of @ref Timer.
     * 
     * In practice the stack will not set a @ref Timer to expire more than
     * 7/16*ClockPeriodTicks in the future or in the past. This tolerance of
